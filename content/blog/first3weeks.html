After a brief overview of the facility, he was led to his new office. Yes, his very own office. With his own computer, and desk. This was a monumentally novel experience. To have ones own office was indeed strange, yet added only to the excitement of the experience. This very office, in all reality a repurposed storage room, would soon come to be known as the Vestibule for Expansion. Indeed a vestibule in that it was an entryway, and by expansion, it is meant an expansion of the mind, heart, and beard of that youthful soul that had entered in.</p>
