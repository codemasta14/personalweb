These last two weeks I've been extremely overwhelmed with my new internship. I showed up ready to use some of my powerful statistics and visualization skills, and within a few hours of playing with data realized that most of what I knew wasn't going to be applicable to my work. As I scrambled to find solutions to my problems, and new methods to approach my task at hand, I very quickly realized that in order to succeed I was going to need to teach myself some machine learning skills. I turned to the internet, and after a week and a half of study I managed to successfully train, and tune a Random Forest to predict my 100,000 row test set with pretty good accuracy! It's going to be a lot of fun as I continue to learn!
