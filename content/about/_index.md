## What I'm doing with my life
I am currently attending BYU-Idaho pursuing a bachelors degree in Data Science. Prior to my current major, I spent some time as a Mechanical Engineering, and then an Applied Math major. I'm currently living in Washington working as a data science intern. After I receive my bachelors degree, I plan on pursuing a PHD in statistics.

## What does Unabatedly Eigen mean?
I decided to name my website Unabatedly Eigen because I have a passion for mathematics, and in particular enjoy linear algebra. Unabated means without any reduction in intensity or strength. Eigen vectors are vectors that when transformed, remain the same and are merely scaled, becoming either a greater, or a lesser version of themselves. I want that to be a testament to my life. That no matter how much I change, learn, or how much success I find, or even failure, I won't lose my core identity that gives my life purpose, and makes me who I am. I will only become a greater version of myself.
