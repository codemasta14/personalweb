## What I'm doing with my life
I am finishing my last couple semesters at BYU-Idaho pursuing a Bachelors degree in Data science, and a minor in Applied Math. I'm currently looking into graduate schools and am interested in finding a PhD program in computer science working on machine learning related research. Check out my Linkedin to learn more!

## What does Unabatedly Eigen mean?
I decided to name my website Unabatedly Eigen because I have a passion for mathematics, and in particular enjoy linear algebra. Unabated means without any reduction in intensity or strength. Eigen vectors are vectors that when transformed, remain the same and are merely scaled, becoming either a greater, or a lesser version of themselves. I want that to be a testament to my life. That no matter how much I change, learn, or how much success I find, or even failure, I won't lose my core identity that gives my life purpose, and makes me who I am. I will only become a greater version of myself.
